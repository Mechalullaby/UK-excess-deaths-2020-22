# This project is about estimating the UK excess deaths 2020-22. Given the 
# observed data sets, `lt1720uk.dat`, which contains 7 columns:
# `age` - the age classes, where 0: 0-1 years
# `fpop17` and `mpop17` - the female and male populations of each age band at 
# the beginning of 2017
# `fpop20` and `mpop20` - the same but at 2020.
# `mf` and `mm` - female and male per capita death rates computed from 2017-19

# and `death1722uk.dat`, which contains:
# `deaths` - the number of deaths each week
# `week` -  the week since the start of 2017
# `d` -  the mortality rate modifier


# We will estimate the excess deaths in two ways:
# 1. Using the population model, for week j and age class i:
#             Di = 0.9885*dj*qi*Ni, 
#             Ni_star = Ni-Di, 
#             Ni_plus = Ni_star*51/52+N(i-1)_star/52, 
#             where i-1,...,101.
# Di - the number of deaths of week j
# dj - the mortality rate modifier for week j
# qi - the expected proportion of dying (qi=1-exp(-mi/52))
# mi - the annual deaths rate
# Ni - the population at the start of week j
# Ni_plus - the population at the start of week j+1
# Set N0_star = N1 at the start, given the function `pre_death`, which can 
# predict the deaths, the excess deaths from 2020 is calculated.

# 2. Using a time series model, the excess deaths in week i, xi:
#             mu1 = alpha,
#             mu(i+1) = (xi-alpha)*rho+alpha,
#             xi ~ tk(mui, tau)
#             where i=1,...,n
# tk(mui, tau) is a scaled t distribution, given the prior, tau ~ exp(1), 
# rho ~ U(0,0.9), alpha ~ N(0,tau=0.0001), k ~ U(2,100). MCMC is used the 
# draw 10000 sample from the posterior densities.


# The study ploted 6 plots to show the results, which would be explained below.
